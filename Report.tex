\section{Introduction}

With the rise in global warming and increasing pollution levels on metropolitan roads, it is becoming essential to find a viable alternative to reduce the pollution on the crowded roads. \\

Metros across the world bear the major brunt of environment pollution and Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) is 3 times the level WHO above annual average in in these cities which is having an adverse affect on the health of people and biodiversity nearby.\\

The Aim of this project was to create a product to lessen the pollution level on busy roads where the main criteria being it's cost and environment friendliness in terms of both efficiency and materials. This Report present design of six such forms, where initially we build the need statement, specified the product specification to come up with a single form upon evaluating them on benchmarked product. \\

Finally the most efficient product design is proposed with detailing of the process after product specification were screened with user requirement, need statement and effectiveness of the cost. \\

\section{Objective}

\label{sec:examples}

The project aims towards reducing the amount of Particulate matter in the air around busy roads. Our desired product should be better than the existing solutions like anti-pollution mask, smog sucking bikes etc. and should provide better environment around busy roads. We expect our product to be able to reduce PM10 and PM2.5(particulate matter of 10 and 2.5 micron) levels on such roads significantly resulting in an environment that is pollution free and harmless to human life. The product should ensure and maintain clean air and provide safety to nearby biodiversity. On the whole, the product we aim to design should reduce concentration of particulate matter in the air around heavily crowded roads.

\section{User and Literature Survey}

\subsection{User Survey}

Due to the seriousness related to the issue, it is decided to do the user survey by observation and direct interviewing. The main asked were as follows, 

\paragraph{Questionnaire}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do you face traffic daily?
\item Do you use open Vehicle like auto and bikes?
\item Do you face any problem due to air pollution?
\item Whether you faces health related problem due to pollution?\item Is minimization of air pollution on roads a good solution?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Analysis of Data}
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Literature Survey}
\begin{itemize}
\item Filtering Mask
\begin{itemize}
\item Easily available and user friendly

\caption{\label{fig:}Parasitic Robots}
\end{figure}

\end{itemize}

\section{Need Statement}

\textbf{To design a sustainable solution to the problem of air pollution on busy roads that is not user specific and is cheap and efficient.}

\subsection{Expectations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Should tackle problems like tearing of eyes
\item Energy-efficient
\item Less noisy
\item Not user specific
\item Cost effective
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Product Specification}

\subsection{Benchmarking}
To get to know more details about specification of the product with some benchmarked products in this field. Gas Mask and smog sucking being the most prominent, we benchmarked specification with them.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{benchmarking.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:}Benchmarking}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\subsection{Quality Function Deployment (QFD)}
For our quality function deployment we gathered the engineering specifications that our product must have and mapped it with our customer requirements. We also benchmarked our product against existing product that dominates the market i.e the pollution gas mask.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{QFD.png}
\caption{\label{fig:}Quality function Deployment}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Specification of the product can be divided into two broad categories which are listed below.

\subsection{Qualitative Specification}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Seasons shouldnâ€™t effect it} \\
As the product will be open to atmosphere, so it must not be affected by any particular season. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{four_seasons_by_nalmes.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:}Different seasons}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Tough Casting Material} \\
Frequent accidents and other damages on roads can be catastrophic for the product so the material used must be tough.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{tough.png}
\caption{\label{fig:}Stress vs Strain curve}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Energy Efficient and Low Power Consuming} \\
70\% of energy still is being produced by non-renewable sources and that would be indirectly affecting the nature.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{power1.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:}Power Grid}
\end{figure}

\newpage

\item \textbf{Maintenance and Installation Cost} \\
As the product is being used in public domain so its maintenance cost must be low and to avoid unnecessary Traffic on roads.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{maintenance.png}
\caption{\label{fig:}Under Maintenance}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Water Proof} \\
Flooding of Roads in rainy season is a very common issue in many developing countries so the product must be water proof to protect it's electronic component.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{roads.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:}Waterlogging}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Less Noisy and attractive} \\

It should produce the least possible Noise and should be aesthetically pleasing also. Noise pollution is a major concern for crowded roads as it is producing around 80dbA loudness on the busy with heavy traffic. 

\newpage

\begin{figure}

\section{Concepts}

By examining our user needs we generated a few concept that deliver their requirements and can be possible solutions to the problem of air pollution. Details of those concepts is discussed below.

\section{Concept Evaluation and Selection}

Evaluation of concept against the user needs and the way they fulfilled there need. We visualized the scenarios that our product might face while functioning. We listed out pros and cons for each concept that we developed. We used techniques like Pugh's selection method to evaluate each concept.

\subsection{Pugh Concept Selection Method}

Those concepts which have positive score were considered in further iteration for pugh concepts selection.

\section{Results}

The results that we expect to obtain from our design project are as follows, 

\begin{itemize}
\item Cleaner air around busy roads in major cities.
\item Better environment around the more polluted parts of the city.
\item Lower \textbf{PM10} and \textbf{PM2.5} levels for the city resulting in a better quality of air for everyone to breath.
\item A reliable system that ensures clean air and better surrounding ensuring conservation of biodiversity around polluted roads.
\end{itemize}  

\newpage

\section{Concluding Remarks}

There isn't a doubt that the world needs a solution to the problem of pollution in this age of ever growing requirement of energy. \\

Reducing pollution is the more sensible approach as escaping it would not be an option in a few years. Transportation being one of the most influential factors for the increasing pollution in the air has to be targeted and by our product we are doing the same. \\

Instead of making people survive the existing pollution we are making the environment cleaner for humans to live in. Unlike conventional measures which are incapable of delivering a better quality of air for people, our product will help making the environment around busy roads in big metropolitans around the world pollution free and clean. \\

As the solution to the problem of pollution that we proposed is un-thought of,  there will be numerous challenges surrounding the development of the same. Some major challenges include

\begin{itemize}
\item Reducing product's installation and production price to an extent that it's comparatively cheaper for Governments and Industries to install.

\item Making it look aesthetically appealing as it needs to stay in public domain and none of us would like to see a hideous box ruining the city's beauty.

\end{itemize}

As the challenges are tough we need to make the processes and materials involved in the production of our product efficient and cheap. With that done we don't want it to hinder the lives of people living nearby so it shouldn't be noisy and eventually the product should turn out to be alluring in order for it to be likable by the people that pass by. \\ \\ \\ \\ \\
